# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
This repository contains an implementation for the *Getting and Cleaning Data* Course Project from Coursera's *Data Science Specialization*. The project instructions and specifications can be read in the following link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project

The project basically consists in downloading a data set (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) with measurements taken from a group of 30 people assigned to do a series of physical tasks while using a Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone recording their movements.

The files listed below are the ones you will find in the repository:
* `run_analysis.R` - This is the R script that processes and cleans the data set provided. Comments were added for a better understanding in its execution.
* `tidy_data.txt` - A tidy data set obtained after running `run_analysis.R`. 
* `CodeBook.md` - The project CodeBook. Contains an explicit description of what the R script does and how `tidy_data.txt` file was generated, the data files that were used, and all the variables that participated in it.
